A small mavenized demo of JavaFX using FXML.

In order to build this, the JavaFX runtime is required.  To my knowledge it is not available
in any public maven repository at this time.  I understood this was a licensing issue (and it may still be)
but I thought Oracle completed the open sourcing of Java and the license restriction of
the runtime distribution but then I am not an attorney.

Therefore, for now, the JavaFX runtime should be installed in your local maven repository.  You can
do so by first downloading the runtime from Oracle if you have not already done so.

Next, use a command similar to this one: 

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=jfxrt.jar -DgroupId=com.oracle -DartifactId=javafx -Dpackaging=jar -Dversion=2.1.0-beta-b15 /opt/javafx-sdk/rt/lib/jfxrt.jar

I suggest using the exact version in general but it's particularly important here because 
JavaFX seems, at least to me, to be changing relatively fast.

The last parameter is the fully qualified name/location of the runtime jar file which is jfxrt.jar
